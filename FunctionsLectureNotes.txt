1. Build out CONDITIONAL
2. Break things out in functions
3. Error handling
4. Data validation

Single Responsibility Principle (or SRP) is one of the most important concepts in software development.
The main idea of this concept is: all pieces of software must have only a single responsibility.

BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS
max()
min()
len()
type()
Touch on built in functions
Touch on type conversion functions
If the function cannot convert, it will complain.
Important to note: int can convert floating point values to integers but it doesn't round off; 
it will truncates the value or chops off the fraction part
These are built in functions that convert values from one type to another

FLOATS and CURRENCY
Floats are bad for precision and we will talk about the why soon. 
If you just cant wait: https://smirnov-am.github.io/representing-money-in-python/
This a built in function to round it to two decimal places
After we round the float to 2 decimal places we must convert the value to a string do concatentation

NONE DATA TYPE
https://realpython.com/lessons/python-none-overview/
The None keyword is used to define a null value, or no value at all.
None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. 
None is a data type of its own (NoneType) and only None can be None.

MATH MODULE
Pull Modules in when needed
This is the math module. We must import it to access many mathmatical functions
The statement aboves creates a module object named math

NEW CONDITIONAL TYPE
ternary operator
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

Parting words:
Read Chapter 4! We didn't get to touch on random numbers. 
The author has a really good summary on random numbers -- it will come in handy later

CHALLENGE:
Per my flooring research, it is common to include an additional 10% to account for waste.
Create a new function that returns flooring price with waste.
Hint: 
def calcualteFlooringPriceWithWaste(area, selectedFlooringPrice):
    squareFootageWithWaste = area * 1.1
    // Finish this function

BONUS:
Ask the customer if they would like to include 10% waste in their final quote.
If no, just calulate the flooring price without waste
If yes, calculate flooring price with waste
